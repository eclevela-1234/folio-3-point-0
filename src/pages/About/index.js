        The Backstory
      </h2>
      <div className="blurb my-2 bg-light bg-opacity-75 p-1 rounded">
        <p className="">
          I got my first taste of coding on a TI-82, circa Y2K. I created a few
          simple games and eventually dabbled in Visual Basic. Currently I work
          in retail management. I earned my MBA with an analytics focus in
          2020. Completing my data analytics and visualization certificate in
          2021, I revived my true love of coding. My passion is solving real
          world problems with technical solutions that meet people where they
          are.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          I completed my full stack boot camp certificate in November 2022! I am
          confident in my abilties to take on any project and see it through. I
          am most familiar with the MERN stack but I can figure most things out
          and enjoy working on a team. I also have experience with Python, R,
          VBA, Tableau, and other analytics apps. I have tenacious work ethic,
          working many late nights and sacrificing my weekends to learn this
          skillset! I am excited to take my skills, experience, and knowledge as
          I pivot into a more technical role in full stack development!
        </p>
        <p className="">
          I spend my nights and weekends with my wife, three children, and toy
          poodle. We like to travel all across the globe whenever we can. Lately
          we've been doing a lot of camping and hiking up and down the east
          coast. I also enjoy tinkering on my '87 Chevy Suburban. I will always
          work hard so when the time comes, I can enjoy those moments.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          Enough about me! While you're here, please take a look at my best work
          to date. I hope you'll enjoy! Please don't hesitate to send me a
          message if you have a project idea, job prospect, or just to say hi.
          Thanks for stopping by!
